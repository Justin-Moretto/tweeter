# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that uses AJAX and jQuery.

The user submits tweets which are added to the timeline, which is uploaded and sorted instantly.
Formatted for all devices, mobile and desktop. 
Tweets must be less than 140 characters otherwise an error message will be displayed. To compose a tweet, the user must click the "write new tweet" to toggle the text area. While the user is scrolling through the tweets and wishes to return to the top of the page they can click the arrow button in the bottom right corner.
